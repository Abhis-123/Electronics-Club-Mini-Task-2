**Problem Statement:** To design a voice commanded chess game with automatic movements according to voice commands.

**Ideating Solution:**

Steps needed: Voice => conversion to text => Arduino => motors => moving pieces => repeat

Process | Solutions available | Advantages | Disadvantages
--------|---------------------|------------|--------------
Voice to text conversion| 1. Android apps (using google voice) <br/> 2. offline speech to text devices <br/> 3. deivising our own sample device using deep learning | 1. simple and direct application including many languages and related features <br/> 2. same as (1) along with elimination of internet usage <br/> 3. low chances of error due to limited combination of words and very cost-effective | 1. uses internet and high chances of error <br/> 2. costly, high error chances, difficult to work with arduino <br/> 3. lengthy process of data inclusion with ML <br/>
