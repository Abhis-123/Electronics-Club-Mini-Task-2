**Problem Statement:** To design a voice commanded chess game with automatic movements according to voice commands.

**Ideating Solution:**

Steps needed: Voice => conversion to text => Arduino => motors => moving pieces => repeat

Process | Solutions available | Advantages | Disadvantages
--------|---------------------|------------|--------------
Voice to text conversion| 1. Android apps (using google voice) <br/> 2. Offline speech to text devices <br/> 3. Deivising our own sample device using deep learning | 1. Simple and direct application including many languages and related features <br/> 2. Same as (1) along with elimination of internet usage <br/> 3. Low chances of error due to limited combination of words and very cost-effective | 1. Uses internet and high chances of error <br/> 2. Costly, high error chances, difficult to work with arduino <br/> 3. Lengthy process of data inclusion with ML <br/>
Transmission to arduino| 1. Using android app and transfer via bluetooth <br/> 2. Communication along I2C synchronous serial protocol | 1. Wireless, high speed and low power communication <br/> 2. Simple, wired and easily compatible communication| 1. Connection issues <br/> 2. Low speed and high energy module
Reaching out to pieces to be moved | 1. Relay activating electromagnets and attracting iron base of that chess-piece <br/> 2. Motors unlocking that chess-piece from its place <br/> 3. Individual sensors/receivers for each piece and activation via a sensor module.| 1. Allows high attraction, smooth and easy movement <br/> 2. Cheap method, easy to implement, low energy and eliminates chances of unlocking other pieces like in (1). <br/> 3. allows high automation, quality and easy method of arduino and piece interactions | 1. Chances of attracting other pieces along with it, high current requirement <br/> 2. System may corrode/break with time <br/> 3. Very costly and difficult to setup, needs good practical sensor knowledge.
Moving pieces using motors | 1. Move along with magnetic interactions as in (1) above <br/> 2. Moving along deep hole lines between houses <br/> 3. Wheeled movement or directly 'flying' to final position. | 1. Easy and smooth movement <br/> 2. Faster movement without any chance of interacting/collision with other pieces <br/> 3. Good quality, less collision chances and attractive/interesting movements | 1. Slower movement and chances of interactions with other pieces. <br/> 2. May degrade/break with time <br/> High current requirement and need good knowledge about sensors.
