**Problem Statement:** To design a voice commanded chess game with automatic movements according to voice commands.

**Ideating Solution:**

Steps needed: Voice => conversion to text => Arduino => motors => moving pieces => repeat

Process | Solutions available | Advantages | Disadvantages
--------|---------------------|------------|--------------
Voice to text conversion| 1. Android apps (using google voice) 2. offline speech to text devices 3. deivising our own sample device using deep learning | 1. simple and direct application including many languages and related features 2. same as (1) along with elimination of internet usage 3. low chances of error and very cost-effective | 1. uses internet and high chances of error 2. costly, high error chances, difficult to work with arduino 3. lengthy process of data inclusion with ML
